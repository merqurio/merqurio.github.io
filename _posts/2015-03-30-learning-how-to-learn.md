I had a hard time during my career to keep up with everything I had to learn.
My habits were to blame. Here is a little collection of tricks that helped me
to create new habits.

## 1. Types of attention

Learning hard thing requires **time and attention**. Our brain is made by
million of billion of synapsis and has a very complex structure. Understanding
how it works, made me work more efficiently.

We have **two types of attentions,** and depending in the task we are working
on we should use one or another.

#### Focused mode
- Detailed attention. The attention we are used to talk about.
- *"Focused mode"* is perfect to resolve repetitive tasks and it helps you
  creating new pieces of memories (a.k.a [chunks](#chunks)).

#### Diffused mode
- Big perspective, the thinking you do while you are focused in other
  activities that don't need all your attention.
- *"Diffused mode"*, helps you understanding complex concepts, and it's perfect
  to develop new ideas or to understand hard concepts.
- Needs a different state of mind. A more abstract thinking. It can be achieved
  in  different ways. A great example is while doing any kind of physical
  activity like running. An
  [example](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729023.100-how-should-we-use-the-keys-to-sleep.html#.VS0qsiOqqko).

## 2. Types of memories

We have lot of different types of memories, like muscular, or olfactory. For
studying there are two that are important and stand out.

#### 1. Working memory:
- In the prefrontal cortex
- 4 slots of attention
- Inefficient blurred blackboard
- Creates neural patterns

#### 2. Long-term memory:
- Wide and distributed
- Redundant and accesible
- Using it regularly makes it easier to retrieve memory chunks
- Repetition makes stored patterns more accessible and defined

Both of them are necessary to create new knowledge, but knowing how they work
helps you to use them more efficiently.

Memory is located in the hippocampus, and there are studies that showed that
even in adulthood, exercise and learning creates new neurones and synapses
there.

## 3. Creating knowledge Creating knowledge is an **active task** and by making
an active effort learning is easier than just doing a passive effort like
listening. Using the knowledge you are acquiring makes it easier to learn.

Knowledge is stored in **information units**. Those units must be first created
then stored and finally reinforced. To store them, the working memory must
create them, creating a neural pattern in the long-term memory that is
reinforced each time we use that unit of information. Those units are called
chunks.

<a id="chunks"></a> **Chunks**, are unique pieces of information throw a
meaning.

#### To create new chunks:
1. Using your **focused mode** create a chunk in your working memory.
   - This creates a new **neural pattern**.
   - Connects with existing ones.

2. Try to understand the **main basic idea**. Trying to understand **why**
something is that way can ease the work and make it easier to remember.

If you are nervous, all those slots in the working memory became blurry and
makes the retrieval of chunks harder.

It's important to have a *big picture* of a subject before starting to learn
little chunks. It's like a map, you need to understand in it's totality before
you start learning each neighbourhood or a streets name.

<a id="4"></a>

## 4. Keeping knowledge To keep a chunk fresh, you must maintain that pattern.
That needs an extra effort.

1. **Repeat** and work on that chunk.
2. **Recall**. Try to remember it. Without looking.
   - Recalling is better than mind-maps or rereading.
   - Helps to build internal neural hooks.
3. **Test yourself.** See how much you remember.
4. **Do it.** You will amplify the pattern you created. Try to do an activity
that uses that chunk as part of the process.
5. Gaining **context**, lets you master that chunk.
   - Learn when to use or not.
   - Use the **Diffuse mode** to find it's place and connections in the *big
     picture*.
6. **Practice** will make the pattern more easily accessible.

#### Library of chunks Having different and bigger libraries will help you to
solve problems more easily in new and different ways. When you have a big chunk
library, previously studied concepts can help you to learn new ones, even if
they are not related at all. Having a big library, diffused mode can create new
a creative things.

#### Mastering something To master something means to use those chunks you
already know as a base to create more and deeper knowledge. If you have
expertise in only one area, you will be able to have more robust knowledge on
that specific area, but mastering more than one area will help you to find new
and creative solutions more easily.

### Tips &amp; tricks

#### Association with mental images A nice and easy way to remember thing is to
enhance your chunks with images that represent the data in an image. Example a
patients look when has X disease.

#### Memory palace technique

Based on the fact that we’re extremely good at remembering places we know. A
‘Memory Palace’ is a metaphor for any well-known place that you’re able to
easily visualise. That familiar place will be your guide to store and recall
any kind of information.

1. Choose Your Palace
2. List Distinctive Features (Analyse the room methodically)
3. Imprint the Palace on Your Mind
4. Associate! (Make it crazy, ridiculous, offensive, unusual, extraordinary)
5. Visit Your Palace

## 5. Importance of sleep

Sleeping **easies the process** of creating new memories. Sleep is part of the
memory system. Patterns created during the day are reinforced, helps to
understand chunks that could not be clear.

When we are awake, our brain creates metabolites. Those **metabolites are
cleaned** during the sleep. That makes sleeping before an exam, extremely
important.

## 6. Habits and becoming a better student

Changing an habit is hard when people keep the same behaviour. Our environment
unconsciously drive our behaviours due to the automatisation around them. If we
keep an environment the same, **we perform those *habits* unconsciously** and
makes them hard to fight.

**Disrupting** the environment in some way, **easies changing** those habits.

### Important habits:
- Highlight **only** important things.
- Make side annotations on key concepts.
- **Time spaced repetition** based learning:
   - Is better 30 mins everyday than lot of hours one day.
   - Create chunk revise it after → 24h, 5days, 20days
- Recall in **different places**, so you get used to use that knowledge in
  diverse places. The day of the exam you'll be used to work with that
  knowledge in different places.
- Try to **avoid the illusion of competence** by testing yourself or by
  recalling without any help at all.
- If you made a mistake:

   - Do not blame yourself
   - Revise and check **why** that is the correct answer.

## 7. Workflow The firsts steps must be a **first approach** the subject you
are just about to learn. Understanding the subject itself and its importance in
a global context. Next step is to understand the parts that make the subject.

![Learning process]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/uploads/process.svg)

Once you have that **global view**, you can start working on **new chunks**.
This order lets you know when those chunks are useful and how they relate each
other.

Once this process is done, the pattern just created must be worked in order to
achieve an easier access and a deeper and broader understanding of that chunks.

   Global view of subject → Chunk creation → Gain context → Maintainance of
   chunks

## 8. Creativity Criticism makes you being creative by looking to the same
problem in different ways. **Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,**
agreeableness and neuroticism help you to avoid seeing a problem in the same
way again and again. While openness helps you to see a problem in many ways it
will be through conscientiousness that you achieve a solution and by not being
agreeable that you can start over with a different perspective.

## 9. Motivation
- People can enhance neurones by using patterns that use those neurones. Try to
  do enjoyable active task that require you to think on those things.
- 99% perseverance 1% genious.
- Only when you take your path, learning flies.
- There is always people that will mean your efforts.
- Remember, you study for yourself, not for others.
- Take pride of who you are.
- Your difference will make you unique in your path. Be proud and make sure to
  take advance of your skills.
- Right hemisphere → Big picture
- Left hemisphere  →  Make interpretations, analysis but is rigid and
  egocentric
- You must not fool yourself and you are the person that most easily can fool
  yourself.
- Try working together with others

## 10. Procrastination

Procrastination is a **natural impulse** every person has. You feel unhappy
when starting a task that may require an effort and your brain tries to set
your attention in another task to make you feel better temporally.

There are **tools and techniques to help avoiding** procrastination and to work
more efficiently.

- Do the **hardest thing earliest in the day**, when you are fresh.
- Take breaks. They are as important as study.
- Work a little bit everyday in a task you don't like.
- Focus on the process, not the product
- Keep track of achievements
- Jump to easier tasks when stuck  → More efficient study

#### 1. Pomodoro technique
[(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) → Work in highly
focused time intervals and then take a break.

- Decide on the task to be done
- Set the timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)
- Work on the task until the timer rings
- Take a short break (3–5 minutes)
- After four intervals, take a longer break (15–30 minutes)

#### 2. Create positive routines

- Plan your work for tomorrow
- Plan your quit time
- Weekly task list
- Leave time for enjoy everyday
- Reward yourself after completing a positive routine (Bigger reward for bigger
  tasks)


<a id="11"></a>

## 11. Overlearning Once you understand a concept, repeating the concept in the
same session doesn't help to memorise it better. It's important to try to focus
on those things that are harder to you. Keep on studying until you find
something harder and focus on it → Deliberate practice.

- **Einstellung** → An existing pattern prevents yourself from finding a new
  one. Use *diffused mode* for abstracting from previously stablished patterns.
  They can be a roadblock because you keep trying to see a problem in a unique
  way. Do not be agreeable.
