title: 3D plotting made easy

Lately, I've been working a lot on data with multiple dimensions. I'm used to
work a lot with [Bokeh](bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) but one of it's
limitations is 3D. Matplotlib always offers a way of plotting almost anything I
can imagine, but this time I didn't want to sacrifice the interactivity that
I'm used to have in Bokeh.

The last couple of months I've been doing a nice [Python
postgrade](http://www.ub.edu/quimica/extensio_u/python_cientifics.html) in the
UB by [Ramon Crehuet](https://ramoncrehuet.wordpress.com/) and [Fermin
Huarte](https://webgrec.ub.edu/webpages/personal/ang/000325_fermin.huarte.ub.edu.html)
and one of the most exciting things we have been working with is a service
called [plotly](https://plot.ly/).

I'm not a huge fan of using a proprietary service for doing research, but in
this case it looked like a great way to go. It's easy to install and easy to
integrate inside the Jupyter Notebooks.

There is just one observation I would like to do, WHY is this the easiest
plotting library ever ? It's super easy and very very intuitive to use..

Set the credentials:
```python

from plotly.tools import set_credentials_file
set_credentials_file(username='xx', api_key='xx', stream_ids=['xx', 'xx'])

```

Then [look for the plot](https://plot.ly/python/reference/) type you want to
create, in this case a 3D Scatter made from a 3D random walker with 4 walkers:

```python

def adimensional_random_walkers(walkers, steps, dimensions):
    workers = np.zeros(walkers*dimensions)
    for i in range(steps):
        random_step = np.random.randint(-1, 2, size=walkers*dimensions)
        workers = np.c_[workers, random_step]
    return np.cumsum(workers, axis=1).reshape(walkers,dimensions,steps+1) # +1 for starting point

four_walkers = adimensional_random_walkers(4, 100, 3)

```
```python

from plotly.plotly import iplot
from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter3d, Data, Marker

walkers = []

for walker in four_walkers:
    trace = Scatter3d(
        x=walker[0],
        y=walker[1],
        z=walker[2],
    )
    walkers.append(trace)

data = Data(walkers)

iplot(data, filename = 'four-3d-random-walkers')

```

<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~merqurio/91/" target="_blank" title="trace0_y, trace1_y, trace2_y, trace3_y" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~merqurio/91.png" alt="trace0_y, trace1_y, trace2_y, trace3_y" style="max-width: 100%;width: 936px;"  width="936" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="merqurio:91" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>


Very useful to if doing a
[PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and you want
to check the result in a moment:

```python

from plotly.plotly import iplot
from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter3d, Data, Marker

# First three dimensions from reduced X VS the Y
trace0 = Scatter3d(
    x=Reduced_with_PCA[:, 0],
    y=Reduced_with_PCA[:, 1],
    z=Reduced_with_PCA[:, 2],
    marker=Marker(color=Y, colorscale='Portland'),
    mode='markers'
)
data = Data([trace0])

iplot(data, filename = 'pca-cloud')

```

<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~merqurio/85/" target="_blank" title="" style="display: block; text-align: center;">
        <img src="https://plot.ly/~merqurio/85.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="merqurio:85" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>
