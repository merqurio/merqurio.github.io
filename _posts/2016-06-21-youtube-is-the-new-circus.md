I'm sure you all have heard this quote in some way or other:

> … Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions — everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses
> [(Juvenal, Satire 10.77–81)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)

For me what the "circus" is has changed over time but I remember a time where I proudly thought that I wasn't the kind of people that could be nulled by the "circus", because I didn't enjoyed Soccer. So naive. I spent my time being productive, and that made me what I am… but with the ubiquitousness of the internet, a new "circus" emerged to match the people who might not be the target of other popular stuff like Basketball, Video Games …

My first realisation that I was alienated was with Facebook, then Twitter, now YouTube. It's hard to realize when a great product begins to make you behave like an addict. I guess accepting it it’s the first step.

This is just me realizing how vulnerable I am.

I should add YouTube to the forgiven hosts at `/etc/hosts`, at least a couple of weeks.
